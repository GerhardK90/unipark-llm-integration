# Unipark → ChatGPT API Integration

A lightweight demo showing how to integrate a Unipark survey (or any web form) with the **ChatGPT API**. This project includes:

- `backend.py` – simple Python backend that forwards prompts to ChatGPT and returns responses.
- `llm.html` – minimal frontend which lets users send inputs and view AI responses.

**Perfect for prototyping** interactive assistants embedded in surveys—for summarizing answers, offering suggestions, guiding users through questions, or let them rate LLM replies!
